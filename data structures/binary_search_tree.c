/*
  Binary search tree - binary_search_tree
  Time Complexity:
    Worst case: O(n)
    Best case: O(n)

  Node:
    value of the node
    pointer to left node - left is less than value
    pointer to right node - right is greater than value

  Pseudo Code:
    Searching:
      Search(tree, key)
        If tree is empty
          Return -1
        Else
          mid = (tree.left + tree.right) / 2
          If key is less than tree[key]
            Search(tree->, key)
          Else if key is greater than tree->key
